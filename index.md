## We are Hiring!

- [Full-Stack Developer](https://officeluv.applytojob.com/apply/Lv6mQy0m2I/Full-Stack-Engineer?source=officeluv.github.io)

## Team Principles

### Trust & Accountability
We trust our members to make the best decisions possible with the information they have. We hold each other accountable to improve ourselves and the work we produce.

### Solve the Right Problem
Starting with basic insights, we build solutions targeted at specific outcomes. 

### Collaboration Through Communication
We clearly articulate our ideas to make our products and each other better.

### Be Curious
We encourage each other to constantly explore, eagerly question, and openly learn.

### Think Big, Solve Small
We tackle big problems with small, iterable solutions. Products should be composable to address larger uses.

### Know Who They Are and Care About What They Want
Our users are the key to our success; we are dedicated to understanding them and helping them succeed.  

### Strong Beliefs, Loosely Held
We fight fiercely for our ideas. We also change and adapt our positions readily in the light of new information.
